The main part of the lvm setup checks whether the provided volume group
exists and if not, creates one from the ramdisk. It then creates a
logical volume if there is no logical volume, takes a snapshot from the
logical if there is logical volume but no snapshot, and merges with the
snapshot if both the snapshot and the logical volume are present.

Inputs Needed in yaml file:
---------------------------
disk: Name of the disk on which volume groups, logical volumes,
      snapshots are created. Created on loop device if not specified
vg_name: Name of the volume group.
lv_name: Name of the logical volume.
lv_size: Size of the logical volume as string in the form "#G"
         (for example 30G).
ramdisk_vg_size: Size of the physical volume to be created.
ramdisk_basedir: Base directory to place the sparse file
ramdisk_sparse_filename: Name of the sparse file.
lv_snapshot_name: Name of the snapshot with origin the logical
                  volume.
lv_snapshot_size: Size of the snapshot with origin the logical
                  volume also as "#G".
override_flag: Flag to override default policy. Override flag
               can be set to -1 to force remove, 1 to force create, and 0
               for default policy.

# fs_mark options:
#  -n 10000000: The number of files to be tested per thread (more on that later)
#  -s 400; Each file will be 400KB
#  -L 1: Loop the testing once (fs_mark testing)
#  -S 0: Issue no sync() or fsync() during the creation of the file system. 
#  -D 10000: There are 10,000 subdirectories under the main root directory
#  -d /mnt: The root directory for testing; for this particular test, we are using only 1  #   root directory
#   -N 1000: 1,000 files are allocated per directory
#   -t 10: Use 10 threads for building the file system
#   -k: Keep the file system after testing
#   -N 10,000: Allocate 10,000 files per directory
